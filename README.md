# AWS CloudFormation Templates Repository

Welcome to my AWS CloudFormation templates repository! This repository contains a collection of CloudFormation templates that I've created and customized for various projects, all inspired by the concepts I learned during the AWS workshop.

## About the Workshop

Idea of this repository is based on the **[AWS CloudFormation Workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/cfn101-workshop)**, which provided valuable insights into deploying and managing infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `templates/`: This directory holds the CloudFormation template files. Each template is designed for a specific use case or application architecture.

- `examples/`: In this directory, you'll find practical examples of how to use the CloudFormation templates provided in the `templates/` directory.

- `docs/`: Here, you can find supplementary documentation, guides, and explanations to help you understand the templates and their usage. See [Docs](docs/DOCS.md)

- `labs/`: Here, you can find my aws labs 


## Getting Started

If you're new to CloudFormation, follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Browse the `templates/` directory to explore the various CloudFormation templates available.

3. Check out the `examples/` directory for practical use cases and deployment scenarios.

4. Refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory for in-depth explanations of each template's components and parameters.

## Usage

1. Choose a template from the `templates/` directory that suits your project's requirements.

2. Review the template's documentation to understand the parameters and resources it uses.

3. Deploy the template using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Make sure to provide the necessary parameters and customize the deployment as needed.
